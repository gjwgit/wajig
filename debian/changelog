  * README, TODO, NEWS: if doc path (/usr/share/doc/<package name>) for
    a given package isn't found, check if such a package even exists.
  * INSTALL, INSTALLSUGGESTED: make --recommends and --norecommends options
    conflict.
  * INSTALL: one can now specify a mixture of installables:
    * deb files
    * url files
    * normal packages
    Previously, only one of these types could be installed at a time
  * make bash completer also complete lower-case COMMANDS;
    patch by "Reuben Thomas" <rrt@sc3d.org>
  * Reinstate --simulate and --teaching options:
    - the --simulate option implies that the epilogs of the --help option
      are now redundant so they are now removed. All they did was state what
      commands would be ran.
    - the --teaching option is renamed to --teach (for sake of consistency)
    - Closes: #665729
  * LOCALUPGRADE remove:

wajig (2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  NEW
  * TODO: new command that reads package TODO files

  UI CHANGES
  * Optional arguments should be available only to COMMANDS that use them:
    - [ole] wajig --verbose install <package>
    - [new] wajig install --verbose <package>
  * FILEINSTALL: removed in favor of INSTALL option, -f|--fileinput:
    - [ole] wajig FILEINSTALL <filename>
    - [new] wajig INSTALL --fileinput <filenames and/or packages>
    Note that with this new option, one can specify multiple files and
    packages on the command line.
  * FILEREMOVE: applies to REMOVE as FILEINSTALL applies to INSTALL (see above)
  * FILEDOWNLOAD: applies to DOWNLOAD as... (see above)
  * PURGE: for sake of consistency, give this -f|--fileinput option too
  * REMOVE, PURGE: add --noauth option, to avoid cases where a package would
    be downloaded when there's an unauthenticated version available; this
    happens in a case where removing/purging a package leaves a void
    where APT want to be smart/convenient, and install a replacement.
  * Improve usability by limiting verbosity to either True or False.
  * Rename LISTRECOMMENDED --> RECOMMENDED
  * Remove the sanitation of wajig COMMANS, e.g. where 'LISTcommands',
    'list-commands', and 'li-st_COMMA-nds' would be translated to
    'listcommands'; it's too much magic (and too much work to get it to work
     with argparse)
  * LISTCACHE: remove ability to filter output; user can always run grep
    themselves
  * LISTNAMES: same as LISTCACHE
  * LISTPACKAGES: same as LISTCACHE
  * LISTSTATUS: same as LISTCACHE
  * NEW: 'wajig new --install' replaces the less elegant 'wajig new install'
  * NEWUPGRADES: 'wajig NEWUPGRADES --install' replaces the less elegant
    'wajig NEWUPGRADES install'
  * RELOAD: if this fails, try FORCE-RELOAD

  DOC CHANGES:
  * DOWNLOAD: improve description. (Closes: #627173)
  * DESCRIBE: Last character in short description missing; LP: #923041
  * DEPENDENTS: improve output

  REMOVED
  * The "--pager" option is really excess, considering that user can simply do
    "wajig COMMAND | pager" by herself
  * The "--pause" option was only useful for gjig (IIRC) to avoid windows from
    closing up automatically, in order to allow one to read the output
  * All "--quiet" option did was redirect output to /dev/null;
    when the option is used, if there is, for example, a Yes/No prompt, it
    won't be seen and it will appear like wajig is stuck; user can easily do
    own redirection (wajig COMMAND > /dev/null), so let's reduce the bloat
    - this change accidentally fixed an exception; Closes: #661269
  * Ability to specify backup directory; requires too much work in order to
    make it work with argparse
  * Me wonders if the mini-tutorial was useful to anyone
  * The "--simulate" and "--teaching" options:
    - they don't apply to a lot wajig commands
    - they display ugly output
    - I doubt if anyone will miss them
  * SETUP: it's an alias of EDITSOURCES and it appears that it was
    added since it was the name of a long-removed Debian tool, 'apt-setup'
  * LISTWIDE: it's basically the same as LIST command
  * LISTALL: it's exactly the same as LIST command
  * VERSION: it's already provided by 'wajig --version'
  * a file named COMMANDS: the content is now generated dynamically
  * AUTOINSTALL:
    - [ole] wajig AUTOINSTALL <package>
    - [ole] wajig INSTALL --yes <package>
  * INSTALLWITHDIST:
    * [ole] wajig INSTALLWITHDIST/<dist> <package>
    * [new] wajig INSTALL --dist <dist> <package>
  * FILE{INSTALL,REMOVE,DOWNLOAD}: see UI CHANGES section
  * SHOWDISTUPGRADE: all it does is simulate DISTUPGRADE
  * SHOWUPGRADE: all it does is simulate UPGRADE
  * SHOWINSTALL: all it does is simulate INSTALL
  * SHOWREMOVE: all it does is simulate REMOVE

  BUGS FIXED
  * INSTALLS/SUGGESTS: specifying multiple packages was broken, and too much
    so work to fix, so limit to just one
  * LIST-SCRIPTS: fix brokenness which was a result of porting to Py3k.
  * MADISON: get rid of duplicates from output, if any.
  * RECONFIGURE: remove dependency on gkdebconf; the implementation was so
    broken that gkdebconf never got invoked
  * Don't run "su -c" when root (patch by  Francesco Poli); Closes: #664231

  MISC
  * Bump minimum required Python version to 3.2 due to new dependency on
    argparse (which replaces the less featureful getopt)
  * Update to debhelper compat level 9
  * Fix some lintian warnings

wajig (2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * port to Python 3 (Closes: #600059, by making it irrelevant)
  * AVAILABLE: add back to bash auto completion
  * WHICHPACKAGE: use apt-file and dpkg instead of custom implementation
    to search for package content
    * local implementation could not use path as search term if package
      is not installed
    * it could also not work offline if the package is not installed
    Closes: #422500, LP: #141520
  * INSTALL: when installing a DEB file, install its dependencies too
  * UPDATE: rm dependency on dselect; use apt-get instead

wajig (2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Tshepang Lekhonkhobe ]
  * Change versioning from 3 digits to 2. There wasn't much meaning there.
  * Remove gjig; it was more an experiment than a serious app, and:
    - more complete alternatives exist (e.g. synaptic and software-center)
    - UI is cranky and weird
  * Remove deps that were needed by gjig:
    - python-gtk2, python-glade2, python-gnome2, and gnome-terminal
  * INSTALLR, INSTALLRS: 'apt-get install' now installs Recommends by default,
    making these options redundant.
  * INSTALL, INSTALLS: add -r|--recommends and -R|--norecommends options.
  * INSTALLS: add -n|--noauth and -y|--yes options.
  * Add meself to Uploaders field in debian/control.
  * CHANGELOG: change -x to -P; it's a more meaningful short option for --pager
  * POLICY: more than one person has complained about removal of the alias of
    this command, AVAILABLE; I put it back.
  * SHOW: add -f|--fast to offer apt-cache's much faster implementation
  * INSTALL/DIST: fix brokenness, fixes LP: #540740.
  * SOURCE: don't run the command unless 'dpkg-dev' is installed,
    fixes LP: #662018
  * BUILD, BUILDDEP: add -y|--yes and -n|--noauth options.
  * AUTOREMOVE: add back after more than one request. (Closes: #590089)
  * Add --dist, an alias for apt-get -t|--target-release.
  * Slightly simplify the build: getting rid of dynamic bash completion
    generator.
  * Fix a Lintian complaint (add dependency on python).

wajig (2.0.50) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Tshepang Lekhonkhobe ]

  * VERIFY: Add a check for debsums before running the command, and add
    a Suggests on it.
  * PURGE: use apt-get instead of dpkg, in order to get a yes/no prompt.
  * LIST-LOG: Remove custom logging implementation
    - was fragile: sometimes info was lost during a run
    - was expensive: checked system cache both before and after the
      operation to determine what happened; it also did this for commands
      which didn't even change the system cache
    - did not log cache changes when they were done by other tools
      (apt, aptitude, & synaptic)
    - APT log looks much better
  * SHOW: use aptitude instead of apt-cache
    - the output is prettier
    - better virtual package handling; it displays real packages that provide
      the functionality implied by that virtual package, instead of just
      vomiting "package not found!"
    - only displays info on the installed version; else, the latest available;
      apt-get showed all available versions
    - the trade-off is that the command is slower, but what's the rush :)
  * LIST-RECOMMENDED: new command that displays packages which are
    auto-installed via Recommends, and are without installed dependencies.
    (Closes: #482147)
  * PURGE: also purge packages that were installed via a Recommends and have
    nothing depending on them; this makes PURGE-DEPEND reduntant.
  * REMOVE: also remove packages that were installed via a Recommends and have
    nothing depending on them; this makes REMOVE-DEPEND reduntant.
  * AUTO-REMOVE: Made reduntant by above REMOVE change, so removed.
  * AUTO-INSTALL: Deprecated in favour of "--yes INSTALL", so removed from docs.
  * NEWS: 'new' command that displays package NEWS file(s).
  * AVAILABLE: removed a badly-named and redundant command; POLICY
    command does the same thing.
  * INSTALL: accept -y|--yes option, an alias for apt-get's --assume-yes.
  * UPGRADE: accept -y|--yes option, too.
  * FIX-INSTALL: accept -n|--noauth option.
  * FIX-MISSING: accept -n|--noauth option, too.
  * REINSTALL:  accept -n|--noauth and -y|--yes option.
  * HELP: introduce the convenient "wajig HELP COMMAND" functionality.
  * Remove supression of error messages; Not a good idea.
  * Add dependency on aptitude; It must have been forgotten.
  * Cleanse packaging, drastically :-)
  * Stop using python-support; There was no need for it.

wajig (2.0.49) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Tshepang Lekhonkhobe ]

  * UPGRADE: Don't automatically do an "apt-get update" with the backup
    option; the behaviour is not standard, and is not so-damn-fast.
  * UPGRADE: Add command line argument for --backup to specify target
    directory.
    * Was "wajig --backup upgrade BKDIR".
    * Now is  "wajig --backup=BKDIR upgrade".
  * UPGRADE: Proceed to upgrade after using -b|--backup option.
  * UPGRADE: Remove the option to install listed packages. This helps
    reduce code complexity.
  * CHANGELOG: Now only displays uninstalled entries by default. This
    makes the hacky NEWS command redundant, which is therefore
    removed. (Closes: #424668).
  * CHANGELOG: Add -v|--verbose=1 option to display the whole thing. This
    was the default option, but suggestion offered in #424668 is more
    sane.
  * CHANGELOG: Add -x|--pager option to allow scrolling. This also implies
    -v|--verbose=1 (see above).
  * DIST-UPGRADE: Add -b|--backup=BKDIR option to allow backing up of
    packages before dist-upgrade.
  * BUILD: Now uses sudo instead of fakeroot to avoid permission-related.
    build failures for some packages (EG, fakeroot & cdbs). (Closes:
    #464003).
  * Fix a parsing bug where "wajig changelog libgtk2.0-0" didn't work.
  * Switch to dpkg-source 3.0 (native) format
  * RBUILDDEPS: New option allowing one to determine which packages
    build-depends on a particular package. The long form command is
    "reverse-build-depends", else just use "wajig rbuilddeps pkgname".
    (Closes: #335240).
  * SEARCH: Make apt-cache's "--names-only" default. Use "-v" option to get
    old behaviour.

wajig (2.0.19-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Fix problem when using sudo, and running wajig as root - if root
      was not in sudoers file then wajig could not run. root did not need
      to be in the sudoers file to run wajig - added a check for root
      running wajig and if so, don't use sudo if sudo is installed.
      Bug reported by Serge Matveev (Closes: #288849).
    - Fix bug with PURGE-ORPHANS whereby sudo was being doubly used
      and causing problems if root was not in sudoers. Bug reported by

      packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/..../<pkg>_<version>/changelog.
      Delay in the updating of changelogs.debian.net links pointed out

wajig (2.0.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - Add new command SNAPSHOT which prints each package installed and

      collection of packages at some later stage with the RESTORE
      command (yet to be implemented). Suggested by Dirk Eddelbuettel.
    - Update README command to report missing READMEs and missing doc
      directory. Suggested by Gintautas Miliauskas.

wajig (2.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version released today

  * Upstream version number jumped as both a new Gui (gjig) and some new
    features were; minor revision .4 is the first public release Graham
    sent me. As usual, see his changelog for the full details.

  * The new gjig gui requires python-gtk2, python-glade2, and python-gnome2 
    which implies another, larger set of other packages -- so that for now,
    we only Suggests: these gui components as to not force a whole new set
    of packages onto systems which would use only the tried and tested 
    command line version of wajig. Long term, maybe gjig should be in its
    own package and depend on wajig. Or maybe I'm going overboard here.
  * This also implies a Depends on the actual version supplying the default
    gtk2, glade and gnome modules, so we now Depend on the default Python
    version and conflict with the next one up as per Python Policy.
  
  * Upstream fix for 'apt-cache show run as root' (Closes:# 229330)
  
  * debian/control: Depends on python now 'python (>= 2.2)' (Closes: #228778)
