  * AUTO-ALTS, UPDATE_ALTERNATIVES: update update-alternatives binary
    location (/usr/sbin -> /usr/bin);
    this has since been changed in a 2013-07-26 dpkg upload, which could
    mean no one uses these subcommands :(

  * CHANGELOG: avoid an exception that occurs when piping the output to
    a pager, and then quitting without reading all of that output
  * MOVE: check if apt-move is installed before trying to use it
  * Bash completion was broken in 2.16; so careless!

wajig (2.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * WHICHPACKAGE: do not do the sneaky thing where apt-file is only used
    when there are no results from 'dpkg search'; instead, display
    installed matches in one list and uninstalled matches in another;
    also get rid of '--simulate' and '--teach' CLI options... they'd be a
    lie here, given the extra logic

  * LISTFILES: display contents of uninstalled packages if apt-file is
    installed; also, as with WHICHPACKAGE above, remove '--simulate' and
    '--teach' options, for the same reason

  * LIST-DAEMONS: use chkconfig instead of some overlong command line to
    display these sysv services

wajig (2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * UPDATE: fix performance issue (patch by Robert Luberda); Closes: #705241

  * improve package description:
    - simpler
    - less boastful
    - add a pointer to a guide
    - tis 'wajig', not 'Wajig'

  * SEARCH:
    - make -v|--verbose match short package descriptions in addition to
      package names
    - add -vv, which also searches long package descriptions and displays them;
      the former was available as -v, and the latter is new;
      this functionality was suggested by Reuben Thomas
    - add debtags search; this happens if the string '::' is in the search term

  * SEARCH, INSTALL: fix weird bugs where package '0ad' could not be searched
    for or installed; LP #1182264

  * update TUTORIAL to reflect that allowing any case for commands has
    since been removed; LP #1033536

  * PURGEORPHANS, REMOVEORPHANS:
    - remove --teach option
      + it would need to be too complex in order to be accurate since it
        runs 2 commands, the second one using output of the first
      + this also gets rid of an ugly (and broken) workaround

  * PURGEORPHANS: remove --noauth option; it doesn't make sense here

  * REMOVEORPHANS: add --yes option, for consistency with PURGEORPHANS

  * replace internal function with a more thorough stdlib shutil.which()
    for checking if a particular executable exists;
    this bumps minimum Python dependency to 3.3

  * LISTLOG: add APTLOG as synonym, in place of an erroneously-added SYSLOG

  * DESCRIBE: if package does not exist for native architecture, check if it
    does for configured foreign ones before giving up; this is closely
    related to the above-mentioned fix

wajig (2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  IMPROVEMENTS
  * improve bash completion, thanks again to Reuben Thomas; Closes: #597721
  * avoid displaying a stack trace when quitting an operation (Ctrl+C)
  * the --simulate and --teaching options now display the commands in bold;
    they now also have consistent spacing (single space) between
    non-whitespace characters
  * REMOVEORPHANS, PURGEORPHANS: for the sake of consistency with REMOVE
    and PURGE subcommands, use the --auto-remove option of apt-get;
    Closes: #444150
  * INSTALL, INSTALLSUGGESTED, NEWUPGRADES, AUTODOWNLOAD: use --auto-remove
    option. Seems a more sane way to have that as default, and leads to a
    less-surprising REMOVE/PURGE experience (whereby it would remove packages
    that are not related to packages being removed).
  * INSTALL: when installing using the url method, do keep the downloaded file;
    it will be found in "~/.wajig/$HOSTNAME/"

  BUGS FIXED
  * INSTALLSUGGESTED: don't fail when one of the Suggested dependencies is
    a virtual package, but instead install one the Providers of that
    virtual package.
  * {REMOVE,PURGE}ORPHANS: fix exception that happened with --simulate option
  * AUTODOWNLOAD, TOUPGRADE, NEWDETAIL: fix an exception that occurs when
    ~/.wajig dir is removed
  * fix 'displays incorrect new and upgradeable package count';
    patch by Graeme Hewson; LP #892410
  * fix '"wajig status" gives warning message about stdin not sorted';
    patch by Graeme Hewson; LP #978172

  RESTORED FUNCTIONALITY (Closes: #667856)
  * LISTALL: this was mistakenly removed, so restore it
  * LIST{CACHE,NAMES,PACKAGES,STATUS,INSTALLED}: restore ability to filter on
    a pattern; some people complained about the removal of the feature (in 2.3)
  * TOUPGRADE: sort the list, again
  * restore ability to have multiple-word commands to be separated with dashes,
    e.g. an alias for LISTINSTALLED is LIST-INSTALLED

  MISC
  * remove the (Suggests) dependencies on fping and wget; Python stdlib is
    capable enough
  * README: improve setup instructions, thanking Graeme Hewson (from LP #892410)
  * NEWUPGRADES: doesn't seem to provide much more than TOUGPRADE, so alias it
  * AUTODOWNLOAD, NEW: get rid of --install option; it's overkill
  * PURGEREMOVE: remove --teaching and --simulate options; they display
    incomplete output
  * UNOFFICIAL: simply open the search results page with a web browser instead
    of scanning it and displaying suitable lines for "/etc/apt/sources.list";
    that feature was broken (and nobody complained)

wajig (2.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

wajig (2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * README, TODO, NEWS: if doc path (/usr/share/doc/<package name>) for
    a given package isn't found, check if such a package even exists.
  * INSTALL, INSTALLSUGGESTED: make --recommends and --norecommends options
    conflict.
  * INSTALL: one can now specify a mixture of installables:
    * deb files
    * url files
    * normal packages
    Previously, only one of these types could be installed at a time
  * make bash completer also complete lower-case COMMANDS;
    patch by "Reuben Thomas" <rrt@sc3d.org>
  * Reinstate --simulate and --teaching options:
    - the --simulate option implies that the epilogs of the --help option
      are now redundant so they are now removed. All they did was state what
      commands would be ran.
    - the --teaching option is renamed to --teach (for sake of consistency)
    - Closes: #665729
  * LOCALUPGRADE remove:
    - [ole] wajig LOCALUPGRADE
    - [new] wajig UPGRADE --local
  * LOCALDISTUPGRADE remove:
    - [ole] wajig LOCALDISTUPGRADE
    - [new] wajig DISTUPGRADE --local

wajig (2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  NEW
  * TODO: new command that reads package TODO files

  UI CHANGES
  * Optional arguments should be available only to COMMANDS that use them:
    - [ole] wajig --verbose install <package>
    - [new] wajig install --verbose <package>
  * FILEINSTALL: removed in favor of INSTALL option, -f|--fileinput:
    - [ole] wajig FILEINSTALL <filename>
    - [new] wajig INSTALL --fileinput <filenames and/or packages>
    Note that with this new option, one can specify multiple files and
    packages on the command line.
  * FILEREMOVE: applies to REMOVE as FILEINSTALL applies to INSTALL (see above)
  * FILEDOWNLOAD: applies to DOWNLOAD as... (see above)
  * PURGE: for sake of consistency, give this -f|--fileinput option too
  * REMOVE, PURGE: add --noauth option, to avoid cases where a package would
    be downloaded when there's an unauthenticated version available; this
    happens in a case where removing/purging a package leaves a void
    where APT want to be smart/convenient, and install a replacement.
  * Improve usability by limiting verbosity to either True or False.
  * Rename LISTRECOMMENDED --> RECOMMENDED
  * Remove the sanitation of wajig COMMANS, e.g. where 'LISTcommands',
    'list-commands', and 'li-st_COMMA-nds' would be translated to
    'listcommands'; it's too much magic (and too much work to get it to work
     with argparse)
  * LISTCACHE: remove ability to filter output; user can always run grep
    themselves
  * LISTNAMES: also remove filtering ability
  * LISTPACKAGES: also remove filtering ability
  * LISTSTATUS: also remove filtering ability
  * LISTINSTALLED: also remove filtering ability
  * NEW: 'wajig new --install' replaces the less elegant 'wajig new install'
  * NEWUPGRADES: 'wajig NEWUPGRADES --install' replaces the less elegant
    'wajig NEWUPGRADES install'
  * RELOAD: if this fails, try FORCE-RELOAD

  DOC CHANGES:
  * DOWNLOAD: improve description. (Closes: #627173)
  * DESCRIBE: Last character in short description missing; LP: #923041
  * DEPENDENTS: improve output

  REMOVED
  * The "--pager" option is really excess, considering that user can simply do
    "wajig COMMAND | pager" by herself
  * The "--pause" option was only useful for gjig (IIRC) to avoid windows from
    closing up automatically, in order to allow one to read the output;
    this was only applicable when wajig used to have a GUI, gjig
  * All "--quiet" option did was redirect output to /dev/null;
    when the option is used, if there is, for example, a Yes/No prompt, it
    won't be seen and it will appear like wajig is stuck; user can easily do
    own redirection (wajig COMMAND > /dev/null), so let's reduce the bloat
    - this change accidentally fixed an exception; Closes: #661269
  * Ability to specify backup directory; requires too much work in order to
    make it work with argparse
  * Me wonders if the mini-tutorial was useful to anyone
  * The "--simulate" and "--teaching" options:
    - they don't apply to a lot wajig commands
    - they display ugly output
    - I doubt if anyone will miss them
  * SETUP: it's an alias of EDITSOURCES and it appears that it was
    added since it was the name of a long-removed Debian tool, 'apt-setup'
  * LISTWIDE: it's basically the same as LIST command
  * LISTALL: it's exactly the same as LIST command (future note: not true)
  * VERSION: it's already provided by 'wajig --version'
  * a file named COMMANDS: the content is now generated dynamically
  * AUTOINSTALL:
    - [ole] wajig AUTOINSTALL <package>
    - [ole] wajig INSTALL --yes <package>
  * INSTALLWITHDIST:
    * [ole] wajig INSTALLWITHDIST/<dist> <package>
    * [new] wajig INSTALL --dist <dist> <package>
  * FILE{INSTALL,REMOVE,DOWNLOAD}: see UI CHANGES section
  * SHOWDISTUPGRADE: all it does is simulate DISTUPGRADE
  * SHOWUPGRADE: all it does is simulate UPGRADE
  * SHOWINSTALL: all it does is simulate INSTALL
  * SHOWREMOVE: all it does is simulate REMOVE

  BUGS FIXED
  * INSTALLS/SUGGESTS: specifying multiple packages was broken, and too much
    so work to fix, so limit to just one
  * LIST-SCRIPTS: fix brokenness which was a result of porting to Py3k.
  * MADISON: get rid of duplicates from output, if any.
  * RECONFIGURE: remove dependency on gkdebconf; the implementation was so
    broken that gkdebconf never got invoked
  * Don't run "su -c" when root (patch by  Francesco Poli); Closes: #664231

  MISC
  * Bump minimum required Python version to 3.2 due to new dependency on
    argparse (which replaces the less featureful getopt)
  * Update to debhelper compat level 9
  * Fix some lintian warnings

  [ Tshepang Lekhonkhobe ]
  * Change versioning from 3 digits to 2. There wasn't much meaning there.
  * Remove gjig; it was more an experiment than a serious app, and:
    - more complete alternatives exist (e.g. synaptic and software-center)
    - UI is cranky and weird
  * Remove deps that were needed by gjig:
    - python-gtk2, python-glade2, python-gnome2, and gnome-terminal
  * INSTALLR, INSTALLRS: 'apt-get install' now installs Recommends by default,
    making these options redundant.
  * INSTALL, INSTALLS: add -r|--recommends and -R|--norecommends options.
  * INSTALLS: add -n|--noauth and -y|--yes options.
  * Add meself to Uploaders field in debian/control.
  * CHANGELOG: change -x to -P; it's a more meaningful short option for --pager
  * POLICY: more than one person has complained about removal of the alias of
    this command, AVAILABLE; I put it back.
  * SHOW: add -f|--fast to offer apt-cache's much faster implementation
  * INSTALL/DIST: fix brokenness, fixes LP: #540740.
  * SOURCE: don't run the command unless 'dpkg-dev' is installed,

  * AUTOREMOVE: add back after more than one request. (Closes: #590089)
  * Add --dist, an alias for apt-get -t|--target-release.
  * Slightly simplify the build: getting rid of dynamic bash completion
    generator.
  * Fix a Lintian complaint (add dependency on python).

  * VERIFY: Add a check for debsums before running the command, and add
    a Suggests on it.
  * PURGE: use apt-get instead of dpkg, in order to get a yes/no prompt.
  * LIST-LOG: Remove custom logging implementation
    - was fragile: sometimes info was lost during a run
    - was expensive: checked system cache both before and after the
      operation to determine what happened; it also did this for commands
      which didn't even change the system cache
    - did not log cache changes when they were done by other tools
      (apt, aptitude, & synaptic)
    - APT log looks much better
  * SHOW: use aptitude instead of apt-cache
    - the output is prettier
    - better virtual package handling; it displays real packages that provide
      the functionality implied by that virtual package, instead of just
      vomiting "package not found!"
    - only displays info on the installed version; else, the latest available;
      apt-get showed all available versions
    - the trade-off is that the command is slower, but what's the rush :)
  * LIST-RECOMMENDED: new command that displays packages which are
    auto-installed via Recommends, and are without installed dependencies.
    (Closes: #482147)
  * PURGE: also purge packages that were installed via a Recommends and have
    nothing depending on them; this makes PURGE-DEPEND reduntant.
  * REMOVE: also remove packages that were installed via a Recommends and have
    nothing depending on them; this makes REMOVE-DEPEND reduntant.
  * AUTO-REMOVE: Made reduntant by above REMOVE change, so removed.
  * AUTO-INSTALL: Deprecated in favour of "--yes INSTALL", so removed from docs.
  * NEWS: 'new' command that displays package NEWS file(s).
  * AVAILABLE: removed a badly-named and redundant command; POLICY
    command does the same thing.
  * INSTALL: accept -y|--yes option, an alias for apt-get's --assume-yes.
  * UPGRADE: accept -y|--yes option, too.
  * FIX-INSTALL: accept -n|--noauth option.
  * FIX-MISSING: accept -n|--noauth option, too.
  * REINSTALL:  accept -n|--noauth and -y|--yes option.
  * HELP: introduce the convenient "wajig HELP COMMAND" functionality.
  * Remove supression of error messages; Not a good idea.
  * Add dependency on aptitude; It must have been forgotten.
  * Cleanse packaging, drastically :-)
  * Stop using python-support; There was no need for it.

  [ Tshepang Lekhonkhobe ]

  * UPGRADE: Don't automatically do an "apt-get update" with the backup
    option; the behaviour is not standard, and is not so-damn-fast.
  * UPGRADE: Add command line argument for --backup to specify target
    directory.
    * Was "wajig --backup upgrade BKDIR".
    * Now is  "wajig --backup=BKDIR upgrade".
  * UPGRADE: Proceed to upgrade after using -b|--backup option.
  * UPGRADE: Remove the option to install listed packages. This helps
    reduce code complexity.
  * CHANGELOG: Now only displays uninstalled entries by default. This
    makes the hacky NEWS command redundant, which is therefore
    removed. (Closes: #424668).
  * CHANGELOG: Add -v|--verbose=1 option to display the whole thing. This
    was the default option, but suggestion offered in #424668 is more
    sane.
  * CHANGELOG: Add -x|--pager option to allow scrolling. This also implies
    -v|--verbose=1 (see above).
  * DIST-UPGRADE: Add -b|--backup=BKDIR option to allow backing up of
    packages before dist-upgrade.
  * BUILD: Now uses sudo instead of fakeroot to avoid permission-related.
    build failures for some packages (EG, fakeroot & cdbs). (Closes:
    #464003).
  * Fix a parsing bug where "wajig changelog libgtk2.0-0" didn't work.
  * Switch to dpkg-source 3.0 (native) format
  * RBUILDDEPS: New option allowing one to determine which packages
    build-depends on a particular package. The long form command is
    "reverse-build-depends", else just use "wajig rbuilddeps pkgname".
    (Closes: #335240).
  * SEARCH: Make apt-cache's "--names-only" default. Use "-v" option to get
    old behaviour.

  * EDITSOURCES now calls the editor rather than apt-setup because
    the latter is now in a udeb and not generally available.

  * Introduce the --noauth option, which for a DISTUPGRADE will use the
    --allow-unauthenticated option. This is particularly for the case
    where an archive you trust has no signed Release file, but you want

wajig (2.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version released today

  * Upstream version number jumped as both a new Gui (gjig) and some new
    features were; minor revision .4 is the first public release Graham
    sent me. As usual, see his changelog for the full details.

  * The new gjig gui requires python-gtk2, python-glade2, and python-gnome2
    which implies another, larger set of other packages -- so that for now,
    we only Suggests: these gui components as to not force a whole new set
    of packages onto systems which would use only the tried and tested
    command line version of wajig. Long term, maybe gjig should be in its
    own package and depend on wajig. Or maybe I'm going overboard here.
  * This also implies a Depends on the actual version supplying the default
    gtk2, glade and gnome modules, so we now Depend on the default Python
    version and conflict with the next one up as per Python Policy.

  * Upstream fix for 'apt-cache show run as root' (Closes:# 229330)

  * debian/control: Depends on python now 'python (>= 2.2)' (Closes: #228778)
