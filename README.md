# Wajig: Ubuntu System Administration

Wajig is a simplified, all-in-one-place, system support tool for Debian
and Ubuntu. It covers all common (and some not so common) tasks you
may need to perform in managing your computer. It began life in 1995
as the Debian OS emerged with a solid system for packaging GNU/Linux.

It remains a useful tool today, in daily use by a community of users.
