            # Bug #320126. Karl suggested that we use -v to preset the
            # password, which also avoids mixing password failure with
            # command failure but this causes password to be asked for
            # even if the sudoers file indicates a password is not
            # required. This happens in only a few cases, like
            # listnames (if user has no access to sources.list), hold,
            # unhold, it is problematic if the user does not have a
            # password (20210312). The problem is that -v will ALWAYS
            # ask for a password.
            #
            # 20210312 Possible solution: try sudo -n on an innocuous
            # command and check $?. If 1 then a password is required,
            # so proceed to ask for it.

            # part is done as sudo.  TODO: It's not always true that
            # root is required for each part!  E.g. HOLD doesn't need
